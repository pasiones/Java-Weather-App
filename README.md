# Weather Application Project

## Introduction

Weather applications have become essential in our daily lives, aiding in planning schedules, making informed decisions, and staying cautious about weather conditions. This project focuses on creating a user-friendly weather application with enhanced functionality by integrating APIs into a Graphical User Interface (GUI) for delivering accurate and up-to-date weather data.

## Scope and Objectives

- Utilize object-oriented design for the Weather system.
- Implement a GUI using JavaFX and FXML
- Integrate external APIs, such as OpenWeatherInfo, for accurate weather information.

## GUI Implementation

### Packages

- Divided into two parts: "functionality" and "weatherapp", each handling functionalities and GUI components.


### Primary Screen

- Utilizes OpenWeather API for up-to-date weather data.
- Components: buttons (Handle add/remove favourite, search, view history/favourites and units of measurement switch), display weather information.

### Second Screen

- Displays user's search history and favourites
- Components: buttons (switch to primary, clear all history/favourites, options for selecting locations). 

## API Integration and Usage

- Separate classes implement data providers for interaction with OpenWeather APIs.
- Demonstrates usage of various APIs for fetching current weather, hourly and daily forecasts.

## Self-Evaluation

- Map feature could have been implemented given it was developed earlier.
- Utilizes the use of ChatGPT for coding implementation to save time.

## Use of AI

- ChatGPT was used for coding implementation, focusing on maintaining original ideas and functionalities.
- ChatGPT was used to support add comment to generate Javadoc.
